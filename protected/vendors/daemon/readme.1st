We have following daemons:

hirenow
contact_seekers
seekers_response
send_sms
rcv_sms
send_email

And, we user signal_server.php and daemon_starter.php to distribute signals or start/stop daemons.

There pid and logs are stored in /var/www/html/logs/daemons directory. These logs can be seen by /logs/showdaemons.php

It works like this:

1. When employer presses hirenow button -> add to hirenow_request and send a signal
to hirenow daemon.
2. hirenow daemons look for matching seekers and adds them in a matching_seekers table and sends a signal to contact_seekers
3. contact_seekers figures out the communication preferences for the matching seekers and queues a SMS or queues an email in outgoing_SMS table or outgoing_email table and sends signal to send_sms as well as send_email
4. send_sms will send SMS messages based using our SMS gateway API
5. send_email will send email messages 
----> Our seekers now have alerts

6. Whenever a seeker replies that he is interested then an entry is added to active_seekers tables and a signal is sent to seekers_response which is collecting all the active seekers respones. 
----> We now have active seekers which we show to the employer

These daemons are all started by: monitor_daemons.sh
//
// this script should be started at startup of system or whenever we reboot
// if you are changing daemons, kill this script first and restart it
//

All the above daemons act upon SIGUSR1

To wake up a daemon, use the message name same as daemon name and send to that daemon using code similar to:

    $this->load->library('base/signals_lib');
    $this->signals_lib->get_queue(APP_QUEUE_ID);
    $this->signals_lib->send_msg("send_sms");

All constants of code are defined in one place.

define("APP_QUEUE_ID",                          "100379");

This message queue is used through out for signals.
